# preCICE-Openfast Adapter

[OpenFAST](https://openfast.readthedocs.io/en/dev/index.html) is a multi-physics engineering tool for the aero-servo-elastic simulation of wind turbines. It includes modules for the modeling of aerodynamic, structural, and electrical behaviour of on- and offshore wind turbines.

This project aims to couple OpenFAST with CFD simulation tools with the coupling library [preCICE](https://precice.org/). Therefore, a preCICE-OpenFAST Adapter is being developed. The Adapter calls OpenFAST via the C++ API to drive the turbine simulation. Additionally, it calls the preCICE library to communicate and coordinate with CFD solvers like OpenFOAM.

As a first test case, the Adapter should be able to perform the coupled simulation of a single NREL5MW onshore turbine. OpenFAST calculates the forces and internal state of the turbine, while OpenFOAM is used as CFD solver to compute the inflow (see image).

## Run a simulation

- Clone the repository
- Select a [simulation case](https://github.com/LeonardWilleke/openfast-adapter/cases)
- Check the [input files](https://github.com/LeonardWilleke/openfast-adapter/input)
- Compile the necessary scripts
- Run the coupled simulation

Instructions on how to compile the files and run the simulation are given in each case.
